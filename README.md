## System Requirements
* Android 7+ 64bit
* iPhone 6+

## Build
1. Build `breez.aar` and `bindings.framework` as decribed in https://github.com/breez/breez
2. For Android: 
- Symlink `breez.aar` to the `android/app/libs/` directory
- Create a firebase Android app using the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Generate the `google-services.json` (on "Project settings" menu) and copy it to the `android/app/src/client` directory
3. For iOS:
- Copy the bindings.framework directory to the ios directory.
- Create a firebase iOS app using the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Generate the GoogleServices-info.plist and copy it to ios/Runner directory
- Run `pod install` from `breezmobile/ios`
3. Flutter stable channel
- Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
Run these command:
- flutter upgrade

## Run
Now you can use the following commands to run in a connected device the client app or the pos or to build the corresponding apks:
 - flutter run --flavor=client --target=lib/main.dart
 - flutter run --flavor=pos    --target=lib/main_pos.dart
 - flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm64 --flavor=client --debug   --target=lib/main.dart
 - flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm64 --flavor=pos    --debug   --target=lib/main_pos.dart

### Running on testnet
Modify the files under the `conf/` directory:

```diff
# breez.conf
-network=mainnet
+network=testnet
-peer=btcd-mainnet.lightning.computer
+peer=<your btcd node address on testnet>

# lnd.conf
-neutrino.connect=btcd-mainnet.lightning.computer
+neutrino.connect=<your btcd node address on testnet>
```

After the initial sync, go to the _Developer_ menu, get an address to fund with testnet coins with `newaddress p2wkh`, then fund it, and use `connect 03d5e17a3c213fe490e1b0c389f8cfcfcea08a29717d50a9f453735e0ab2a7c003@3.16.119.191:9735` then `openchannel --private --conf_target 1 03d5e17a3c213fe490e1b0c389f8cfcfcea08a29717d50a9f453735e0ab2a7c003 90000` to open a channel to that public node (adjust the amounts and the node id/address if you wish).
